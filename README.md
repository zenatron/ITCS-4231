# Void Runner
#### Final Project for ITCS 4231
Team Members: Adam Kerns, Jackson Franke, and Phil Vishnevsky

## About
Void Runner is a space-themed puzzle-platformer that challenges players to rethink movement and gravity. You move the character throughout the world, passing checkpoints as fast as possible. With a minimalist visual style and innovative mechanics, Void Runner drops you into a spherical maze where you have powers — fast-forward, slow-mo, invert gravity, and jump. It’s a mind-bending experience where every twist of the world is a puzzle piece.
